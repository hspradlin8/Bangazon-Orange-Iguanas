# Building the Bangazon Platform API

Welcome, new Bangazonians!

Your job is to build out a .NET Web API that makes each resource in the Bangazon database available to application developers throughout the entire company.

1. Products
1. Product types
1. Customers
1. Orders
1. Payment types
1. Employees
1. Computers
1. Training programs
1. Departments

> **Pro tip:** You do not need to make a Controller for the join tables, because those aren't resources.

The front end team has been given a prototype API to help them implement a React web application. The prototype is built similar to JSON Server and not a actual long-term solution for persisting and retrieving data. It's now your team's job to build a production ready API to replace the prototype.

If you complete all tickets in your backlog, you should have the following endpoints implemented.

Your front end developers are expecting data back from your API that looks exactly like what's listed below. If certain properties don't match, the client application will break. **NOTE** Don't worry about any differences in dummy data the prototype uses vs the data in _your_ database. The only thing that is important is that the shape of each resource should match exactly.

To see examples from the prototype API you can use this base URL:

\* Order objects that have a payment method that isn't NULL are considered complete and processed. An order that does not have a payment type would be considered a user's shopping cart. A user can have only one shopping cart, and therefore will only have a maximum of one Order record in the database with a NULL payment type at a given time.

\*\* To purchase an order, update the Order object's `userPaymentId` property

## Plan

First, you need to plan. Your team needs to use the official SQL script (see below) and build a  Bangazon ERD using [dbdiagram.io](https://dbdiagram.io). Once your team agrees that the ERD is complete, you must get it approved by your lead developer before you begin writing code for the API.

## Modeling

Next, you need to author the Models needed for your API. Make sure that each model has the approprate foreign key relationship defined on it, either with a custom type or an `List<T>` to store many related things. For example, a `ProductType` has many `Products`s associated with it, and therefore you will want a property of `List<Product>` on the `ProductType` model.

## Database Management

You will be using the [Official Bangazon SQL](./Bangazon.sql) file to create your database. Create the database using Visual Studio.

## Controllers

Now it's time to build the controllers that handle GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE operations on each resource. Make sure you read, and understand, the requirements in the issue tickets.
